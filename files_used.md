# Files Used for Training Molecular Diffusion Models

This document lists all the files required to train the molecular diffusion models in this project.

## Main Sender Scripts
These are the primary scripts used to initiate training:

- `main_sender_mainmodel_fps.py` - Initiates training for the diffusion model with fingerprints
- `main_sender_mainmodel.py` - Initiates training for the diffusion model
- `main_sender_timepred_fps_finetune.py` - Initiates training for the time prediction model with fingerprints fine-tuning
- `main_sender_timepred.py` - Initiates training for the time prediction model

## Main Model Scripts
These are the scripts called by the sender scripts:

- `main_single_fast_v11_ffnet_fps_finetune.py` - Main diffusion model with fingerprints
- `main_single_fast_v11_ffnet.py` - Main diffusion model
- `main_time_pred_fps_finetune.py` - Time prediction model with fingerprints
- `main_time_pred.py` - Time prediction model

## Molecule Generation Scripts
These scripts are used to generate molecules using the trained models:

- `sample-fast-molecularformula-multimolecule_compartefm_fps.py` - Generates molecules using fingerprint-enhanced models
- `sample-fast-molecularformula-multimolecule_compartefm.py` - Generates molecules using base models

## Model Evaluation and Comparison Scripts
These scripts are used to evaluate and compare the models' performance:

- `GuacamolTry.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook for evaluating models using Guacamol benchmarks
- `compare4_guacamol_composite.py` - Script for detailed comparison of models using molecular descriptors and Jensen-Shannon distances
- `compare4_composite.py` - Script for generating composite visualizations and comparative analysis
